- Primitives are passed by value, i.e. a copy of the primitive itself is passed. 
Whereas for objects, the copy of the reference is passed, not the object itself.

- Primitives are independent data types, i.e. there does not exist a hierarchy/super class for them. 
Whereas every Object is descendent of class "Object".

- Every object has some default methods of itself, which it inherits from the 
class Object (e.g. toString(), clone(), wait(), notify(), notifyAll(), etc.). 
The primitives does not have any method associated with themselves.

- Primitives are immutable, they can be used as so without any special care. 
Whereas for objects, special care needs to be taken, they are not immutable by default.
